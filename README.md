# Rock Paper Scissors Game 🪨📄✂️

A simple web-based Rock Paper Scissors game where you play against the computer. This project showcases the journey of building a game with trial, error, and improvements, as shown by the messy code and numerous comments left throughout.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Open `index.html` in your browser and click **Start**.
2. **Choose Your Move**: Click **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.
3. **See the Results**: The computer makes a random choice, and the result of each round is displayed.
4. **Win Condition**: First to reach 5 points wins the game.

## Project Files

- `index.html` – Structure of the webpage.
- `styles.css` – Styling for the game elements.
- `script.js` – Main game logic, including score tracking and win condition check.

## Code Note

The code intentionally contains a lot of comments and unused sections. This reflects the development process and the effort put into experimenting with different solutions, trying various approaches, and documenting the journey.

## Features

- **Interactive Choices**: Buttons to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- **Score Tracking**: Tracks human and computer scores.
- **Win Check**: Declares a winner when either score reaches 5.
- **Development Insight**: Includes commented-out code, showing the steps and iterations involved.

## Future Improvements

- Refactor code to remove unnecessary comments and streamline logic.
- Add animations and sound effects for a more engaging experience.
- Add a reset button for easier game restarts.
